# Project Tracking with Markdown
```
A crazy idea...
```

## Hmm...
* Multiple devs
* Editing the same MD file
* Merging and commiting to Git/GitHub
* And a MD table FTW (for the 'tracking' win)
* A different table per dev, hmm, i-o-g...
* Maybe more of a dev journal with tracking capabilities, hmm...
